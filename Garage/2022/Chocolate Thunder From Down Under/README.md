Chocolate Thunder From Down Under 
Created on 19 Oct 2021
Ever thought 3d printing was boring? Us too. Add some chocolate and its fun!

Our project is a 3d printer that builds with chocolate rather than plastic. 
We have cool ideas and even cooler chocolate because it won’t be melted by the time we’re done with it.

Hopefully we can modify an existing FDM printer or do some fancy SLS ideas. 
We’ll need to add some fancy thermal management features and a ton of tuning to get our chocolate to print. 
We also want to see how much chocolate we can fit in our budget before we raise suspicion with the Build18 exec board.

A few buzzwords: blockchain, ML, AI, deep learning, 3D printing, quantum computing
